            <p>My name is Nicole Barry. I am originally from Rochester, NY and moved to Charlotte, NC three years ago. I
                went to college at St. John Fisher College in Rochester and earned a bachelor's degree in adolescent inslusive
                education and math. I decided I wanted to be a teacher in 5th grade. I love learning math, so I put the two
                together.
            </p>

            <p>When I moved to Charlotte, I became a high school math teacher and swim coach. I enjoyed teaching students
                and helping them understand math in a way they did not before. Recently, I decided I wanted to pursue another
                passion of mine in software/web development. I am excited for this journey to learn more about web and software
                development.
            </p>
